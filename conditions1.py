# The value of 10*4 (40) is greater than 14+23 (37), therefore this 
# comparison expression will return the Boolean value of True.


print(10*4 > 14+23) # Should print True

# The letter "t" has a Unicode value of 116 and the letter "s" has a
# Unicode value of 115. Since 116 is not less than 115, the 
# comparison of "tall" < "short" (or 116 < 115) is False. 

print("tall" < "short")  # Should print False
